# google-clone

I have build a simple google Clone using html and css only. <br />
<b>Live demo on </b>: https://aashishpanthi.github.io/google-clone/

This has the same ability as original google.
Not only it looks like google but it also works like google although it uses the original google search engine for the queries.

# Navigate directly
<p>
  <a href="#google-text-search-page"> Google Text Search page  </a>   <br />
  <a href="#google-image-search-page"> Google Image Search page  </a>   <br />
  <a href="#google-advance-search-page"> Google Advance Search page </a>   
</p>

# Google text search page
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aashishpanthi/google-clone/master/images/index.png" width="800" alt="google search page"/>
</p>
<h2>Interface </h2>
<ol>
<li>In google search page, I have included the links of google image search and google advanced search in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Then I have used the image of the google from original google search page.</li>
<li>I have added two buttons that acts similarto google's button.</li>
<li>At last of the page, I have some links as shown in the google.</li>
</ol>

<h2> Workflow </h2>
<em>You can navigate to other pages from the top right corner links </em> <br />
Then I have our search field where you can <strong>search your queries</strong> and that links to the google search. <em> You can either just press the <strong> enter key </strong> or use
the <ins> Google Search </ins> button to find the result.  <strong>Alternatively, </strong> you can use <ins> I'm felling lucky </ins>button to redirect directly to the first Google search
result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

<li>Then I have four input fields:
  <ul>
    <li> First input field is for the important words. </li>
    <li> Second input field is for the exact words in quotes. </li>
    <li> Third input field is for  miniature OR standard words. </li>
    <li> Fourth input field is for the words that you want to remove from the query. </li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ol>
